## Project Overview
This repository presents the outcomes of our project in the "Basics of Mobile Robotics" course at EPFL. Our team was tasked with programming a differential drive robot, Thymio, to navigate through an unknown environment. This endeavor encompassed gaining practical experience in several key areas:

- Computer Vision
- Path Planning
- Robot Localization
- Robot Control, including obstacle avoidance

The implementation was carried out using Python, with our scripts interfacing with a ROS-like system provided by the Thymio hardware.

## Achievements
We successfully programmed Thymio to autonomously navigate and adapt to its environment. This included:
- Developing image processing techniques for environmental perception.
- Applying path planning algorithms to navigate from start to goal.
- Integrating a Kalman Filter for accurate localization.
- Implementing motion control and obstacle avoidance strategies.

A sped-up video showcasing Thymio's navigation can be viewed [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81572776/153708500-784dddef-6b9c-4efc-996d-09a122e975ed.mp4).
